Description: Extracts sentiment and sentiment-derived plot arcs 
  from text using three sentiment dictionaries conveniently 
  packaged for consumption by R users.  Implemented dictionaries include
  "afinn" developed by Finn {\AA}rup Nielsen, "bing" developed by Minqing Hu 
  and Bing Liu, and "nrc" developed by Mohammad, Saif M. and Turney, Peter D. 
  Applicable references are available in README.md and in the documentation 
  for the "get_sentiment" function.  The package also provides a method for 
  implementing Stanford's coreNLP sentiment parser. The package provides 
  several methods for plot arc normalization.
