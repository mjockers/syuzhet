1032:           Hence I decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations.
1033:                                                                             ( I knew this before hand, and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format.
1034:                                                                                 If you don't have a gray card, you can use a plain white piece of paper.
1035: Relative to what I can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr, the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh, flat images with ugly hot spots.
1036:                                                                                            Unless you are making posters, a g3 is more than good enough.

   4: Before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support, or run the player over with your car, try these simple troubleshooting ideas first.

7093:                            Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.
