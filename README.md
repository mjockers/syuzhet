# Syuzhet
An R package for the extraction of sentiment and sentiment-based plot arcs from text.

The name "Syuzhet" comes from the Russian Formalists Victor Shklovsky and Vladimir Propp who divided narrative into two components, the "fabula" and the "syuzhet."  Syuzhet refers to the "device" or technique of a narrative whereas fabula is the chronological order of events.  Syuzhet, therefore, is concerned with the manner in which the elements of the story (fabula) are organized (syuzhet).

The Syuzhet package attempts to reveal the latent structure of narrative by means of sentiment analysis.  Instead of detecting shifts in the topic or subject matter of the narrative ([as Ben Schmidt has done](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2014/12/fundamental-plot-arcs-seen-through.html)), the Syuzhet package reveals the emotional shifts that serve as proxies for the narrative movement between conflict and conflict resolution.  This was an idea inspired by the late Kurt Vonnegut in an essay titled "Here's a Lesson in Creative Writing" in his collection *A Man Without A Country* ( Random House, 2007).  [A lecture Vonnegut gave on this subject is available via youTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP3c1h8v2ZQ)
