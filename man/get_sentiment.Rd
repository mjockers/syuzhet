\usage{
get_sentiment(char_v, method = "syuzhet", path_to_tagger = NULL, cl = NULL, lang = "english")
}
\arguments{
\item{char_v}{A vector of strings for evaluation.}

\item{method}{A string indicating which sentiment method to use. Options include "syuzhet", "bing", "afinn", "nrc" and "stanford."  See references for more detail on methods.}

\item{path_to_tagger}{local path to location of Stanford CoreNLP package}


\item{lang}{A string. Only works for "nrc" method}

\item{cl}{Optional, for parallel sentiment analysis.}

}
\value{
Return value is a numeric vector of sentiment values, one value for each input sentence.
}
\description{
Iterates over a vector of strings and returns sentiment values based on user supplied method. The default method, "syuzhet" is a custom sentiment dictionary developed in the Nebraska Literary Lab.  The default dictionary should be better tuned to fiction as the terms were extracted from a collection of 165,000 human coded sentences taken from a small corpus of contemporary novels.
